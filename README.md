# Code-Refactoring-Challenge-1

## Description

With the goal of meeting current accessibility standars, I updated all the HTML non-semanitic tags to sematic tags. I further ensured those semantic tages followed a logical structure. I further added alt attributes to all the image elements. Finally, I repaired non-functioning links in the header and re-title the page.
